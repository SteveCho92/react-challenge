# Connectus Global  FS Engineering Exercise 2020 Q1

### Hello future Connectus star!

We're excited to share this take-home exercise with you. We look forward to discussing your solution soon and hope you find this interesting along the way. We know time can be tight for projects like this. Thank you for making time to work on it. On to the challenge!

## Overview

At Connectus we think [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) is pretty great. It plays the primary role of being the UI that the client uses. We like it as a tool for creating robust frontends with slick features, but more importantly, it provides a framework for organizing all the coponents that make our application run. If you haven't used React before (we believe almost all candidates receiving this exercise have at least some exposure), it is conceptually very similar to Google's AngularJS. If you've used either, we think you'll feel comfortable with the setup here. Using ReactJS and a combination of the provided code and code you write, we'll build a simple SPA that  manages customer input and displays it to the screen.

## What are we building?

A common theme in modern front-end JavaScript libraries/frameworks is that they can help you manage the data in your applications.
Once you update something, React can immediately update the UI, React uses a concept called state to keep data and update our UIs.

At completion, we'll have a small SPA that accepts user data and displays it to the screen in realtime. 

In this React challenge, we'll update data using an input field.

The main tasks are:

1. Use an input field to accept text
2. Update your UI based on that input field
3. Use React state to automatically update your UI
4. Update data using a form


## What are we looking for?

1. A functional component that can be compiled and run succesfully. - Can we run your code and stand up a new stack?
2. The Application code works - typing the username or age updates the relevant fileds on the UI.
3. Written communication - Does your solution include documentation that describes your solution, tips for the reviewer, and any difficulties faced?
5. Opportunities for extension or modification - We'd love to discuss how we can change this small application for the better, how it might change with scale, etc. Keep these in mind as you work and make a note of any great ideas!


## Setup

The code and directory structure contained here provides an outline for a simple ReactJS project bootstrapped with Facebook's CRA (create-react-app), the main index file is where your work will be placed, the css files are complete and no edits are required here.


## Other helpful info

The following commands will be helpful to get started and to test your code...

`npm run start` - builds development code and starts development server

[ReactJS Doc Link](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - Find some very useful information here.


#### Hints:
* It's ok to implement the simplest thing that will work, we can flesh out more features in a later discussion.
* Take notes as you go. These will be helpful for describing your implementation and providing guidance for a reviewer running your code.
* Extra Extra credit for supplying tests that confirm your component is rock solid!
